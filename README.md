# TIPsort Script Collection

Maintainer: Jonathan Williams

## About

These are wrapper scripts for the `TIPsort` codes, intended to automate analysis of TIP data from TRIUMF.  They assume that the `TIPsort` codes (available at https://github.com/SFUNUSC/TIPsort) are installed on the analysis computer and available under the `$PATH` environment variable.
